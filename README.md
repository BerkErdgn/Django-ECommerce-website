# Django-ECommerce website
 
An e-commerce site is a virtual commerce platform where products and services are buy online. Such sites offer a wide range of products to users and enable consumers to easily find and purchase the products they want. On these sites, you can offer products from various categories, such as clothing, electronics, furniture, cosmetics, garden accessories. Users can select the desired product, add it to the cart, pay and receive the product delivered to the specified address.

In this direction, I have made an e-commerce site that automatically displays it in its own category when you add a product, allows users to register and log in, add a product to your cart when you select a product, and make a purchase.

In the front-end part of this site, I used bootstrap and ready-made templates by modifying them according to my own use. But I made the back-end part myself.
